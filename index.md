# Pardon the Clutter
I'm going to get this spun up to handle my rpg stuff, but I haven't used Jekyll in forever, so I'm trying to remember to context for stuff.

Quick check to see if I rememebr how to place images:
![alt text](/assets/6towers01.png "6 Towers Map")

Bah.  Images apaprently need the full path.  Very annoying.

Ok, pushed this into Working Copy, just to play around. Checking - does this have two images above?
